<h1>About</h1>
<p class="center">I am a Music and Sound Recording major at University of New Haven in Connecticut, USA. My experience with music extends back as far as I can remember; I picked up my first instrument in grade school, and I immediately fell in love. I play clarinet, guitar, bass guitar, and keyboard, with a constant desire to pick up and learn new instruments wherever possible. I participated in symphonic, pit, and marching ensembles in high school, and I passed AP Music Theory with an A+ average at the age of 15. Outside of curricular programs, I've played with a multitude of bands and performed at local venues surrounding my New Jersey hometown of Middletown. At UNH, I look forward to expanding my knowledge of both music theory and music production, as well as meeting new people to play and enjoy the gift of music with. My contact information can be found in the "Contact" tab of this website. </p>
